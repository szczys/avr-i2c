AVR ATmega328p Driving 128x32 OLED (SSD1306) via I2C
====================================================

This is a proof of concept for driving an SSD1306 oled display

Pinout:
------------------------------------------------

128x32 OLED (i2c bit bang option)  
GND --> GND  
VCC --> 3.3V  
SCK --> PB6  
SDA --> PB7  

StatusLED  
PB0 --> LED --> 1k --> GND

5-Way Switch  
1 --> PC4  
2 --> PC0  
3 --> PC1  
4 --> GND  
5 --> PC2  
6 --> PC3  

Remarks:
-------------------------------------
The bit-bang version of this i2c SHOULD NEVER BE USED. It's a quick and dirty implementation made just to ensure I understood how the protocol works. It works, but has not been optimized and doesn't have strict timing and doesn't return ACK/NACK for any use.
